# Cloud-Based Healthcare Data Warehouse Management - Hair Loss Dataset

## Overview
The goal of this project is to use Azure tools to create a cloud-based healthcare data warehouse management system for the hair loss dataset. Data processing, safe storage, economical resource use, and perceptive data visualisations are all part of this project that aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of hair health metrics.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Data Processing and Management

#### Azure Data Factory (ADF) Steps:

1. **Azure Cloud Setup:**
   - Create an Azure account using the university email aakash.sukre@ucdconnect.ie.
   - Acquire 94.53 Euro credits for Azure services in my account.
   - Create a dedicated resource group named "HairLossApp-RG."
   - Provide the required resources, such as Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Storage, within the resource group.

2. **Azure Data Factory (ADF) Steps:**
   - Install ADF pipelines, such as "HairLossP1" and "Set Variable."
   - Set up the datasets (cleaned CSV for output and Excel for input).
   - Create data flows like CleanDataset, DataPreprocessing, and IngestData.

3. **Azure Storage Steps:**
   - Set up a storage account and blob container.
   - Upload the raw hair loss dataset (hair_loss_dataset.xlsx) to Azure Storage.
   - Use Azure Storage for data backup, redundancy, access controls, and monitoring.

4. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Create a Power BI account using university credentials same as above.
   - Connect Power BI to Azure Blob Storage to access the cleaned hair loss dataset.
   - Import the dataset and develop visualisations, including charts and graphs.

### 2. Secure Data Storage

- Ensure secure storage of both raw and processed datasets in Azure Storage.
- Utilise Azure Blob Storage features for redundancy, access controls, and monitoring.

### 3. Cost-Effective Resource Utilisation

- Leverage Azure Cloud Services with a pay-as-you-go model for optimal resource utilization.
- Implement cost management strategies, including resource group optimization.

### 4. Insightful Data Visualizations

#### Power BI Visualizations:

- Develop a Power BI dashboard illustrating key metrics related to hair health.
- Include visualizations such as charts and graphs for insights.
- Here you can visualise the dashboard

### 5. Collaboration and Accessibility

- Utilise collaboration features within Power BI service for team collaboration.
- Publish Power BI reports for easy accessibility and interaction with visualised data.
